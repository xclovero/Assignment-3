                <p>My name is Chao Xu. Now I am a student at Langara College. My program here is computer studies in diploma.<br>
                I am international student, and I have got a bachelor's degree in environmental engineering in my home country.<br>
                Furthermore, I worked for Haitong Securities for 8 years, from 2011 to 2019. My position there was sales manager.<br>
                My hobbies are sports and play game. My favorite sport is soccer.<br>
                Because of my passionate for gaming, I chose to quit my job and study computer studies here.<br>
                I like cat and I had a cat in my home country, but he had gone in 2018.</p>
                <img src="images/cat.jpg" alt="my cat" style="width: 128; height: 158px;">
                <p>I also like to travel, but because I am afraid of heights, I don't really like to go to high places.<br>
                When I went to Capilano Suspension Bridge Park, I can only look from a distance and dare not cross the bridge.</p>
